# Shelly
Version: 1.0

Shelly is a framework which makes writing command line applications simpler. It provides common functionality in a manner that lets you concentrate on the functionality of your command and not how it's managed.

**Features**

* Supports command line programs with sub-commands.
* Prebuilt common file list sources.
* Prebuilt common arguments.
* Minimal code requirements to write commands.
* Argument validation and processing.

# Adding to your project

## Swift Package Manager

Add Shelly to your `Package.swift` file like any other dependency:

```
let package = Package(
    name: "YourApp",
    products: [
        .executable(name: "yourapp", targets: ["YourApp"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/drekka/Shelly", .branch("master")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "yourApp",
            dependencies: ["Shelly"]
        ),
    ]
)
```

## Carthage

Simply add this to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "drekka/Shelly" "master"
```

# Creating a command line program

Creating a command line program using Shelly isn't especially hard and the simplest way to do it is to use [Swift's Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). You can start by building your project manually using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Carthage ðŸ˜ƒ](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods), but SPM has the advantage in that it makes it easy to compile all the 3rd party dependencies and Swift libraries into a single executable which you then distribute.

So in this guide I'll build a simple command line program called `lister` using SPM as the core tooling.

## Initial setup

first we need to do some initial setup by creating a directory and running the SPM initialiser command in it:

```bash
~ $ mkdir lister
~ $ cd lister
lister $ swift package init --type executable
```

This creates a template for a new project including some initial source and tests files. Now we need to add some dependencies. In our case, Shelly and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) (which I recommend using with [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest)) to the `Package.swift` file which defines the project, so open it and replace it's contents with this:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.2
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Lister",
    products: [
        .executable(name: "lister", targets: ["Lister"]),
        ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Quick/Nimble", from: "7.0.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/drekka/Shelly", .branch("master")),
        ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "Lister",
            dependencies: ["Shelly", ]
        ),
      .testTarget(
           name: "ListerTests",
           dependencies: ["Lister", "Nimble", ]
       ),
       ]
    )
```



Next we need to download the dependencies and install them. use this command:

```bash
lister $ swift package update
```

Once that's finished we can create the project file using SPM. It will automatically create all the necessary targets and schemes:

```bash
lister $ swift package generate-xcodeproj --enable-code-coverage
``` 

And we're done. Opening the `Lister.xcodeproj` file will show you the project ready for adding your functionality.

### Main

The next thing to do is update the access point to your program. It's fairly simple as we're going to get another Swift class (`Lister`) to do the real work. Edit `main.swift` and add this code:

```swift
import Foundation

do {
    try Lister()
} catch let error {
    Lister.logError(String(describing: error))
    exit(1)
}
```

### Main class

Now we need to create the main class of the program. Create a swift file called `Lister.swift` assigned to the 'Lister' program target and add this content:

```swift
import Shelly

public class Lister: ShellCommand {

    @discardableResult init() throws {
        try super.init(command: "lister",
                       overview: "Listing files super easily.",
                       argumentClasses: [
                           VerboseArgument.self,
                           RootDirectoryArgument.self,
                       ])
    }
}
```

We've just defined our program. Shelly's `ShellCommand` class has a load of functionality built into it include the processing of arguments you pass to your command so lets try it out. Go back to the command line and execute this command:

```bash
lister $ swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-stdlib
```

This will build a release version of the command line program including all it's dependencies and the Swift runtime in a single file binary executable. At the end of the build it should print something like this to tell you where the program is:

```bash
Linking ./.build/x86_64-apple-macosx10.10/release/lister
```

***Note: For the simplicity of this readme, I'm going to assume you'll now add a symlink pointing at the compiled program to avoiding typing the full path like this:***

```bash
lister $ ln -s .build/x86_64-apple-macosx10.10/release/lister lister
```


Try executing it like this:

```bash
lister $ ./lister --help
OVERVIEW: Listing files super easily.

USAGE: lister [--help] [--verbose] [--project-dir <dir>] ...

OPTIONS:
  --project-dir   Base directory of the project. Defaults to the current directory.
  --verbose       Turns on verbose output for debugging purposes.
  --help          Display available options
```

Yey it works. As you can see Shelly has fleshed out the program, adding arguments for verbose and setting a directory. If you look back at the `Lister.swift` file you can see exactly where these arguments where defined through passing a list of argument classes to super. Argument classes defined here are added as arguments to the main program.

## Adding functionality

Generally speaking there are two forms of command line programs. ***Single process*** and ***Sub-command*** based.

### Single process implementation

Single process programs have a single function. For example `ls` lists files, `rm` removes files, etc.

Here's our `lister` class with a single process implementation:

```swift
import Shelly
import Basic

public class Lister: ShellCommand {

    @discardableResult init() throws {
        try super.init(command: "lister",
                       overview: "Listing files super easily.",
                       argumentClasses: [
                           VerboseArgument.self,
                           ProjectDirectoryArgument.self,
                       ])
    }
    
    Override public func execute() {
        let files = try DirectoryFileSource(directory: ".".resolve()).getFiles()
        files.sorted { $0.asString < $1.asString }.forEach { file in
            ShellCommand.log("File: \(file.asString)")
        }
    }
}
```

Defining the process is simply a matter of overriding the `execute()` function. Building and running will now produce something like this:

```bash
lister $ swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-stdlib
Compile Swift Module 'Shelly' (23 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'Lister' (2 sources)
Linking ./.build/x86_64-apple-macosx10.10/release/lister
lister $ ./lister
File: .build
File: .build/build.db
File: .build/checkouts
File: .build/checkouts/Nimble-6408981098330508121
...
```

Not particularly helpful because it's listing Lister's project directory. However there is a project directory argument already in the program which we can use to change the directory we want to list files from like this:

```bash
lister $ ./lister --project-dir ~/Documents
Switched to directory /Users/derekclarkson/Documents
File: doc1.md
File: doc2.md
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

### Sub-command implementation

Sub-command based programs require you to specify a sub-command to tell them what you want to do. For example `swift package` or `git pull`. 

To add a sub-command we first need a sub-command class. Add a file to the project called `List.swift` and add this content to it (remember to assign it to the `lister` target):

```swift
import Basic
import Utility
import Shelly

class List: SubCommand {

    private(set) var arguments: [String: Argument] = [:]

    required init() {}

    func configure(_ commandParser: ArgumentParser) throws -> String {
        let cmd = "list"
        arguments = try configure(commandParser, subCommand: cmd, overview: "Lists files")
        return cmd
    }
    
    func execute() throws {
        let files = try DirectoryFileSource(directory: ".".resolve()).getFiles()
        files.sorted { $0.asString < $1.asString }.forEach { file in
            ShellCommand.log("File: \(file.asString)")
        }
    }
}
```
 
Again Shelly does as much work as possible so you don't have to. All you need to do is to implement the `configure(_:)` method and ensure it calls the `configure(_:,_:,_:)` method to finish registering the sub-command, then implement the `execute()` method to perform the task.
 
Finally we need to add the sub-command to the main program:

```swift
public class Lister: ShellCommand {
    
    @discardableResult init() throws {
        try super.init(command: "lister",
                       overview: "Listing files super easily.",
                       subCommandClasses: [List.self],
                       argumentClasses: [
                           VerboseArgument.self,
                           ProjectDirectoryArgument.self,
                       ]
        )
    }
}
```

And now you can call it like this:

```bash
lister $ ./lister --project-dir ~/Documents list
```

Note how we are passing `--project-dir ~/Documents` before the `list` sub-command. This is because the argument has been added to the program, not the subcommand so it must occur before the subcommand.

#### Adding sub-command arguments

Here's how we add the `--project-dir` argument to the sub-command instead of the program: 

```swift
func configure(_ commandParser: ArgumentParser) throws -> String {
    let cmd = "list"
    Arguments = try configure(commandParser, 
                              subCommand: cmd,
                              overview: "Lists files",
                              argumentClasses: [ProjectDirectoryArgument.self])
    return cmd
}
```

Easy. Now you can call it like this:

```bash
lister $ ./lister list --project-dir ~/Documents
```

Of course it's not a good idea to have the same argument on the program and one of it's subcommands so I'd suggest removing it from the list of arguments in `Lister.swift`.

## Input files

Arguments can also produce lists files for your program to process. For example, the `SourceDirectoriesArgument` generates a list of files from each of the directories you specify. When Shelly is processing arguments it checks each one to see if it's an instance of `FileSourceFactory`. If so, it then asks it for a list of `FileSource` instances. These `FileSource` instances are then queried for a list of files. Finally Shelly merges these lists and removes any duplicates to create a master list of files for your program.

Here's our example updated to source files from a list of passes directories instead of the current directory:

```swift
public class Lister: ShellCommand, FileSourceReader {
    
    @discardableResult init() throws {
        try super.init(command: "lister",
                       overview: "Listing files super easily.",
                       argumentClasses: [
                           VerboseArgument.self,
                           ProjectDirectoryArgument.self,
                           TrailingSourceDirectoriesArgument.self,
                       ])
    }
    
    Override public func execute() {

        let files = try self.argumentFiles()
        files.sorted { $0.asString < $1.asString }.forEach { file in
            ShellCommand.log("File: \(file.asString)")
        }
    }
}

```

The `FileSourceReader` protocol gives the program access to the code to read the list of files from the arguments. We've also added the `TrailingSourceDirectoriesArgument` and changed the process to pull the list of files using the `self.argumentFiles()` function. Shelly with do all the work of reading the directories and feeding them back to you. Here's how it looks on the command line:

```bash
Lister $ ./lister â€”project-dir ~ Documents Pictures
Switched to directory /Users/derekclarkson
File: Documents/doc1.md
File: Documents/doc2.md
File: Pictures/Pic.jpg
File: Pictures/Pic2.png
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

## Arguments

In the above examples we used the `ProjectDirectoryArgument` and `VerboseArgument` prebuilt arguments. Shelly has the following pre-defined arguments:

| Argument | Syntax | properties | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ExcludeArgument` | `--exclude <mask> <mask? ...` | `var excludeMasks: [String]?` | List of masks that can be used to filter files. |
| `GitChangesArgument` | | | `FileSourceReader` implementation that generates a `FileSource` listing of all files that Git thinks have been changed. |
| `GitStagingArgument` | | | `FileSourceReader` implementation that generates a `FileSource` of all files in the Git staging area. |
| `ProjectDirectoryArgument` | `--project-dir <directory>` | | Changing the file systems current working directory to the specified one. |
| `SourceDirectoriesArgument` | `--source-dirs <dir> ....` | | `FileSourceReader` implementation that generates an array of `FileSource`s, one for each of the passed directories. |
| `TrailingSourceDirectoriesArgument` | `<dir> ....` | | Only usable as the last argument in the list, this `FileSourceReader` implementation generates an array of `FileSource`s, one for each of the remaining arguments. |
| `VerboseArgument` | `--verbose` | | Sets a global static variable called `ShellCommand.verbose` which can be tested when deciding what to output. |

### Custom argument

Creating your own argument for your command is quite easy. As an example, let's create a simple argument that prints 'hello' when used. Create a file called `Hello.swift` in the project and add this code:

```swift
import Shelly
import Utility

class Hello: Argument {

    static var argumentSyntax = "[--hello]"

    private let helloArgument: OptionArgument<Bool>

    var sayHello: Bool = false

    required init(argumentParser: ArgumentParser) {
        helloArgument = argumentParser.add(option: "--hello", kind: Bool.self, usage: "Say Hello!")
    }

    public func map(_ parseResults: ArgumentParser.Result) throws {
        if parseResults.get(helloArgument) != nil {
            sayHello = true
        }
    }
}
```

And add it to the main program:

```swift
public class Lister: ShellCommand {
    
    @discardableResult init() throws {
        try super.init(command: "lister",
                       overview: "Listing files super easily.",
                       argumentClasses: [
                           Hello.self,
                           VerboseArgument.self,
                           ProjectDirectoryArgument.self,
                       ])
    }
    
    Override public func execute() {

        let hello: Hello = try self.getArgument()
        if hello.sayHello {
            ShellCommand.log("Hello!")
        }

        let files = try DirectoryFileSource(directory: ".".resolve()).getFiles()
        files.sorted { $0.asString < $1.asString }.forEach { file in
            ShellCommand.log("File: \(file.asString)")
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see we've added `Hello.self` to the list of arguments and when executing, retrieved it and printed the text. Now lets try it out:

```bash
Lister $ ./lister --project-dir ~/Documents --hello
Switched to directory /Users/derekclarkson/Documents
Hello!
File: doc1.md
File: doc2.md
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

#### Producing files

 Making your custom argument produce files for the app to process is quite easy. Implement `FileSourceFactory` and the `fileSources` property and you are done.

```swift
import Shelly
import Utility
Import Basic

class Hello: Argument, FileSourceFactory {

    static var argumentSyntax = "[--hello]"

    private let helloArgument: OptionArgument<Bool>

    var sayHello: Bool = false
    private(set) public var fileSources: [FileSource]?

    required init(argumentParser: ArgumentParser) {
        helloArgument = argumentParser.add(option: "--hello", kind: Bool.self, usage: "Say Hello!")
    }

    public func map(_ parseResults: ArgumentParser.Result) throws {
        if parseResults.get(helloArgument) != nil {
            sayHello = true
            fileSources = [DirectoryFileSource(directory: "~/Documents".resolve())]
        }
    }
}
```
