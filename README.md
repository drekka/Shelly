# Shelly
Version: 1.0

Shelly is a framework which makes writing command line applications simpler. It provides common functionality in a manner that lets you concentrate on the functionality of your command and not how it's managed.

**Features**

* Supports command line programs with sub-commands.
* Prebuilt common file list sources.
* Prebuilt common arguments.
* Minimal code requirements to write commands.
* Argument validation and processing.

# Adding to your project

## Swift Package Manager

Add Shelly to your `Package.swift` file like any other dependency:

```
let package = Package(
    name: "YourApp",
    products: [
        .executable(name: "yourapp", targets: ["YourApp"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/drekka/Shelly", .branch("master")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "yourApp",
            dependencies: ["Shelly"]
        ),
    ]
)
```

## Carthage

Simply add this to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "drekka/Shelly" "master"
```

# Guide - Creating a command line program

Creating a command line program using Shelly isn't especially hard and the simplest way to do it is to use [Swift's Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). You can start by building your project manually using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Carthage ðŸ˜ƒ](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods), but SPM has the advantage in that it makes it easy to compile all the 3rd party dependencies and Swift libraries into a single executable which you then distribute.

So in this guide I'll build a simple command line program called `lister` using SPM as the core tooling.

## 1. Setup

first we need to do some initial setup by creating a directory and running the SPM initialiser command in it:

```bash
~ $ mkdir lister
~ $ cd lister
lister $ swift package init --type executable
```

This creates a template for a new project including some initial source and tests files. Now we need to add some dependencies. In our case, Shelly and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) (which I recommend using with [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest)) to the `Package.swift` file which defines the project, so open it and replace it's contents with this:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.2
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Lister",
    products: [
        .executable(name: "lister", targets: ["Lister"]),
        ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Quick/Nimble", from: "7.0.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/drekka/Shelly", .branch("master")),
        ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "Lister",
            dependencies: ["Shelly", ]
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "ListerTests",
            dependencies: ["Lister", "Nimble", ]
        ),
        ]
)
```

Next we need to download the dependencies and install them. use this command:

```bash
lister $ swift package update
```

Once that's finished we can create the project file using SPM. It will automatically create all the necessary targets and schemes:

```bash
lister $ swift package generate-xcodeproj --enable-code-coverage
``` 

And we're done. Opening the `Lister.xcodeproj` file will show you the project ready for adding your functionality.

## 2. main.swift

The next thing to do is update the access point to your program. It's fairly simple as we're going to get another Swift class (`Lister`) to do the real work. Edit `main.swift` and add this code:

```swift
import Foundation

do {
    try Lister()
} catch let error {
    Lister.logError(String(describing: error))
    exit(1)
}
```

## 3. Lister.swift

Now we need to create the main class of the program. Create a swift file called `Lister.swift` assigned to the 'Lister' program target and add this content:

```swift
import Shelly

public class Lister: ShellCommand {

    @discardableResult init() throws {
        try super.init(command: "lister",
                   overview: "Listing files super easily. Use 'lister subcommand --help' for details on each subcommand.",
                   subCommandClasses: [
                       // ListDirectoryFiles.self,
                       ],
                   argumentClasses: [
                       VerboseArgument.self,
                       RootDirectoryArgument.self,
                       ]
                    )
    }
}
```

We've just defined our program. Shelly's `ShellCommand` class has a load of functionality built into it include the processing of arguments you pass to your command so lets try it out. Go back to the command line and execute this command:

```bash
lister $ swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-stdlib
```

This will build a release version of the command line program including all it's dependencies and the Swift runtime in a single file binary executable. At the end of the build it should print something like this to tell you where the program is:

```bash
Linking ./.build/x86_64-apple-macosx10.10/release/lister
```

Now try executing it like this:

```bash
lister $ .build/x86_64-apple-macosx10.10/release/lister --help
OVERVIEW: Listing files super easily. Use 'lister subcommand --help' for details on each subcommand.

USAGE: lister [--help] [--verbose] [--project-dir <dir>] sub-command ...

OPTIONS:
  --project-dir   Base directory of the project. Defaults to the current directory.
  --verbose       Turns on verbose output for debugging purposes.
  --help          Display available options
```

Yey it works. As you can see Shelly has fleshed out the program, adding arguments for verbose and setting a directory. If you look back at the `Lister.swift` file you can see exactly where these arguments where defined through passing a list of argument classes to super. Argument classes defined here are added as arguments to the main program. Shelly also supports specifying arguments for sub commands and we'll look at that shortly.
